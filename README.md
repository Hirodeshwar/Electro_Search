# ⚡ ElectroSearch - Electrical Device Dictionary

ElectroSearch is a simple, interactive web-based dictionary for electrical components. Users can search for any electrical device and get relevant details (including descriptions and images) through a smart interface powered by a local backend.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Search for common electrical devices like resistors, capacitors, etc.
- 🧠 Smart responses including formatted descriptions and images.
- 🎨 Clean, modern, dark-themed UI built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
- ⚡ Lightweight Express backend to simulate AI or database-like behavior.

## 💡 How It Works

- The frontend collects the user's input and sends a `POST` request to the backend server running on `http://localhost:8080`.
- The backend processes the input and returns a structured JSON response with a description and (optionally) an image URL.
- The frontend formats and displays the result in a stylish, user-friendly manner.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/electrosearch.git
cd electrosearch
````

### 2. Setup and Run the Backend

> Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed.

```bash
npm install
node server.js
```

Your backend will be running on:
👉 `http://localhost:8080`

### 3. Open the Frontend

Just open the `electrosearch.html` file in your browser:

```bash
open electrosearch.html     # macOS
start electrosearch.html    # Windows
```

Or manually double-click the file.

## 🔎 Sample Queries

Try typing any of the following:

* `resistor`
* `capacitor`
* `transistor` (extend backend to support more!)
* `inductor`

---

## 📦 Dependencies

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors)

Install with:

```bash
npm install express cors
```

---

## 📌 Notes

* The backend runs only on `localhost:8080`. If deploying to the cloud (e.g., Vercel or Render), update the fetch URL in the frontend.
* This is a static dictionary — consider integrating with a language model or real API for scalability.

---

## 📈 Future Scope

* 🔌 Add more electrical components with images and structured data.
* 🤖 Integrate OpenAI/Gemini to generate dynamic responses.
* 📲 Deploy frontend and backend for public use.
* 🌐 Add multilingual support for broader accessibility.
